"Code, Courage, and Commitment: My Journey at DeVry University"

Going back to school as a transgender student wasn’t just about earning a degree. It was about proving to myself that I belong in every room I step into — including the tech world.

I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Software Development at DeVry University, and this journey has been about more than code, assignments, and deadlines. It has been about growth, resilience, and building a future that reflects who I truly am.

Starting Over — But Stronger

Making the decision to pursue my degree wasn’t easy. Life doesn’t pause just because you enroll in classes. I balance responsibilities, personal challenges, and the everyday realities of being transgender in spaces that aren’t always built with you in mind.

But here’s what I’ve learned: growth rarely happens inside your comfort zone.

In software development, you’re constantly problem-solving. Debugging. Testing. Rewriting. That process mirrors my life in many ways. Transitioning has meant learning who I am at a deeper level, correcting misconceptions, and confidently stepping into my authentic self — even when it feels uncomfortable.

Just like refactoring code, personal growth takes patience.

Representation in Tech Matters

The tech industry is growing fast, but representation still matters. Being a transgender student in software development sometimes feels isolating. There aren’t always visible role models who look like me or share my story.

But instead of letting that discourage me, I let it motivate me.

Every assignment I complete, every project I submit, and every programming language I learn is a reminder that I deserve to be here. Diversity in tech isn’t just about statistics — it’s about perspectives. My lived experience shapes how I approach problems, collaborate with others, and design solutions.

Innovation thrives on different viewpoints.

The Challenge of Balancing Identity and Education

There are moments when school stress mixes with personal stress. Deadlines don’t care if you’re dealing with emotional challenges. Code won’t compile just because you’ve had a tough day.

But resilience is a skill — just like programming.

At DeVry University, I’ve developed discipline, time management, and persistence. Late nights debugging have taught me patience. Group discussions have strengthened my communication skills. And navigating life as a transgender student has strengthened my confidence.

Each semester completed feels like both an academic and personal milestone.

Why Software Development?

Software development appealed to me because it’s creative and logical at the same time. It’s building something from nothing. It’s solving real-world problems with structured thinking.

There’s something empowering about writing code that works. About seeing your application run successfully. It reminds me that I can build the life I want — one line at a time.

Technology doesn’t judge. It responds to logic, structure, and effort. In many ways, coding has been a safe space for me — a place where my identity doesn’t limit my potential.

Looking Ahead

Earning my BS in Software Development isn’t just about career advancement. It’s about stability. It’s about creating opportunities. It’s about showing others — especially other transgender individuals — that higher education and tech careers are absolutely possible.

I want to be visible. I want to be skilled. I want to contribute.

My journey at DeVry University is shaping not only my future career but also my confidence as a person. Every course brings me closer to graduation, but also closer to the life I’ve worked hard to build.

Final Thoughts

Being a transgender student in software development means navigating challenges that aren’t always in the syllabus. But it also means bringing strength, adaptability, and authenticity into every project.

I am not just learning to write code.

I am building a future.

And I’m doing it unapologetically.
